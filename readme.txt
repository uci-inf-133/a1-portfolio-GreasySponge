--Readme document for Drake Smith, drakes1@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
1.Image in home page
2.Correct headings and paragraph text
3.I simulate multiple pages with a short js function creating "tabs". not sure if this counts or not
4.I have a favicon that adapts to any screen


(b) CSS features
1.Padding and margins(responsive as well)
2.Modified colors to be visually appealing, in my opinion
3.Leveraged bootstrap's grid system (nearly everything is in a row or column)


(c) Advanced features
1.Sidebar with large screens that becomes a dropdown menu with small screens
2.I embedded one of my unity projects in the portfolio tab. This isn't in the advanced options but it's a nice bonus.



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

	Many of the warnings were inaccurate (automatically generated when x criteria is met, although the error it suggests is not present). This was the case for the vast majority of the warnings (I.E. changes in text direction when none are present, alt text does not convey same information as image when it does, Image may be using color alone when it isn't, etc. ad nauseam). I updated my paragraphs to be inside block quotes which actually increased the amount of warnings despite me doing it to address a warning.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

I would estimate about 8-10 hours.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

I had some guidance from Gemini: When I first attempted to embed my unity project, I broke a few things and it helped me fix it. I also asked it for help with my javascript for the tabs.

I followed a W3Schools guide for creating the tabs as well: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I talked to my friend Tedman (also in the class) about the validator before I noticed the assignment 1 channel in slack.

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

The code should run fine, although the Unity project will not run on a local host. I published it to GitHub Pages to show it works if you would like to check at https://greasysponge.github.io/
